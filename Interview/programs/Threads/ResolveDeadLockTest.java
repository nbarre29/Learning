 * 
 *  The below code will create a deadlock situation.
 *  A deadlock is a situation where minimum two threads are holding lock on some different resource, 
 *  and both are waiting for other�s resource to complete its task.
 *  In below case, Thread-1 has A but need B to complete processing and Similarly Thread-2 has resource B but need A first.
