-> The error you're encountering is due to PowerShell's execution policy, which restricts the running of scripts. To resolve this, you can change the execution policy to allow running scripts. Here are the steps:

Open PowerShell as Administrator:

Right-click on the Start menu and select "Windows PowerShell (Admin)".
Set the execution policy:

Run the following command to allow running scripts


PS C:\WINDOWS\system32> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser

Execution Policy Change
The execution policy helps protect you from scripts that you do not trust. Changing the execution policy might expose
you to the security risks described in the about_Execution_Policies help topic at
https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170. Do you want to change the execution policy?
