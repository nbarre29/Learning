The facade pattern is a structural design pattern. In the facade pattern, a facade classes is used to provide a single interface to set of classes. The facade simplifies a clients interaction with a complex system by localizing the interactions into a single interface. As a result, the client can interact with a single object rather than being required to interact directly in complicated ways with the objects that make up the subsystem.

As an example, supposed we have few horribly written classes. For based on the class and method names (and the lack of documentation), it would be very difficult for a client to interact with these classes.
As a result, we need to be able to simplify interaction with this system of classes so that clients can interact with these classes in a simple, standardized manner.
