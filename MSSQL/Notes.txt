select *  from Person.Person;
select * from Person.Address;
select * from Person.BusinessEntityAddress

1. Find a person's address.
->select *  from Person.Person
inner join Person.BusinessEntityAddress
on BusinessEntityAddress.BusinessEntityID = Person.BusinessEntityID
join Person.Address
on Address.AddressID = BusinessEntityAddress.AddressID


->select *  from Person.Person p
inner join Person.BusinessEntityAddress bea
on bea.BusinessEntityID = p.BusinessEntityID
join Person.Address a
on a.AddressID = bea.AddressID

2. Find a person's password and phone number.

select * from Person.PersonPhone

->select * from Person.Person
inner join Person.Password
on Password.BusinessEntityID=Person.BusinessEntityID
join Person.PersonPhone
on PersonPhone.BusinessEntityID=Person.BusinessEntityID

3. Find a person's credit card info.

-> --Now we have the list of people linked to their credit card information.
select * from Person.Person
inner join Sales.PersonCreditCard
on PersonCreditCard.BusinessEntityID=Person.BusinessEntityID
join Sales.CreditCard
on CreditCard.CreditCardID=PersonCreditCard.CreditCardID

-> --List of people that haven't made any purchases.
select * from Person.Person
left join Sales.PersonCreditCard
on PersonCreditCard.BusinessEntityID=Person.BusinessEntityID
left join Sales.CreditCard
on CreditCard.CreditCardID=PersonCreditCard.CreditCardID
where PersonCreditCard.BusinessEntityID is null;

The key difference b/w inner join and left join is that with left join we are not losing any records.
we are adding null's where records don't exist.
